# Color Palette — 19 Color Tokens

Every screen color comes from the single `THEME` definition in `src/company.config.ts`. Colors are not
hardcoded in CSS; `themeStyle` in `src/DemoApp.tsx` injects them at runtime as `--color-*` CSS variables.
Changing one color updates the entire app.

Design intent: place a **warm cream office** inside a **dark charcoal-and-navy product frame**, making the
pixel space appear like a stage floating within the screen.

Room accent colors are defined on each workspace (`WORKSPACES[n].accent`) rather than as tokens —

and Edit Room `#4fc484`.
